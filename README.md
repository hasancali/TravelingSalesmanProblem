# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Traveling Salesman problem, identified as NP-hard problem in optimization. This project is just a fun way of implementing not only using plain C# (arrays, loops, conditionals) but also extensively using LINQ and .NET collections. In performance-critical scenarios, it may force to avoid high-level .NET language features. 

The following assumptions are made.

**1.** Traveling city details are read from a file called Travel.data. (valid entries).

**2.** There is always a direct path for a given two cities.

**3.** Interconnecting cities are satisfying Triangle-Inequality

Based on these assumptions, the implementation follows the Nearest neighbors to find the initial route and then trying to optimize the result with 2-opt optimization.

2-opt  not always gives the optimal solution. There are several other alternative approaches.
